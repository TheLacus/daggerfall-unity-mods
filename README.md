# Real Grass

An addon for [Daggerfall Unity](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity) that uses Unity detail prototypes system and Daggerfall terrain tilemap to add grass and other details. It was originally created by Uncanny_Valley and available as part of main repository, then migrated as a standalone addon with the introduction of mod support.
